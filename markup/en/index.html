        Even if German media hardly ever report on it: Refugees continue to 
        die in the Mediterranean. In January 2018 alone, almost 200 people 
        drowned fleeing to Europe. The EU member states are trying to distract 
        attention from their failure instead of saving lives. The humanitarian 
        corridor over the Mediterranean has been systematically hampered by the
        EU in recent months.

        Libyan militias have declared not only their own waters, but also adjacent 
        international waters as a restricted area for civilian sea rescue missions. 
        The reasons for the flight from Libya remain: The conditions in Libyan 
        camps are inhuman.
      </p>

      <p>
        The EU is not afraid to cooperate with the Libyan dictatorship. In order 
        to block the Mediterranean route from Libya to Europe, EU member states 
        also targeted civil society organisations - documents published for 
        the first time now show how sea rescue was criminalised step by step last year.

        May 6, 2017 – The Iuventa gets bugged
      </h2>

      <p>
        In the spring of 2017, Europe's attention is on the Mediterranean. 
        At least 1000 people have already drowned in the Mediterranean 
        from January to April. The increasingly nervous EU cannot produce  
        a coherent concept to stop the dying. That is why civil society is
        taking the initiative: Twelve NGOs, supported by tens of thousands of 
        people from all over Europe, have bought or chartered their own ships
        for sea rescue. Among them is the German organization "Jugend Rettet",
        which saves people's lives with the ship "Iuventa" in the central 
        Mediterranean Sea.
      </p>

      <p>
       The Italian Maritime Rescue Coordination Council (MRCC), which reports to
       the Italian Ministry of the Interior, is responsible for coordinating rescue
       services. It provides organisations with the procedures for sea rescue: If 
       the authority receives information from one of its various sources about boats 
       in distress at sea, it orders nearby ships to go there. Rescue operations must 
       be discussed with the MRCC. Until reaching a safe harbor, it is up to the MRCC 
       to decide what to do with refugees on board.
      </p>

      {{image name="mrcc-rosie-scammell" language="de" type="content"}}

      <p>
        "Jugend Rettet" made the MRCC look bad in April: On Easter weekend, the 
        "Iuventa" was unable to manoeuvre on the high seas for two days in view of 
        numerous sea rescues and had to make an emergency call. The small ship, which 
        offers just enough space below deck for a crew of 16 people, had 400 refugees 
        on board. Hundreds of other people in the area around the "Iuventa" were in 
        distress at sea. The MRCC, however, was unable to send larger ships to the 
        scene for two days. It was strongly criticised in the international press.
      </p>

      <aside class="aside aside--start">
        {{image name="reporting-easter-weekend" language="de" type="aside"}}
      </aside>

      <p>
        On May 6th, the "Iuventa" receives unusual orders from the MRCC from Rome, 
        which make the crew listen up. Instead of handing over rescued refugees to a 
        larger ship, which will take them safely to a port, the small "Iuventa" is 
        said to be able to take 75 refugees to the Italian port of Lampedusa overnight. 
        After tough negotiations, most of the refugees can be transferred to other ships. 
        However, five of them must still be brought to Lampedusa by the "Iuventa" itself. 
        The MRCC rejects the offer of other ships to take in refugees instead of the "Iuventa".
        The crew must obey. If a ship has rescued refugees on board, the MRCC can determine 
        what happens to them. Although a total of 14 refugee boats are in distress at the 
        same time, the ship has to abort the current mission.

        At the port of Lampedusa, the crew is received by the Italian authorities' 
        emergency services: Members of the Coast Guard, local police and elite 
        anti-terrorist units. Also a German-speaking policeman is among them. The 
        crew will be interrogated, the Iuventa searched. While the ship is in port, 
        23 more emergency calls arrive at the rescue centre in Rome, for which the 
        "Iuventa" cannot help. At least five boats cannot be supplied by the remaining 
        rescue vessels during the upcoming storm in the Mediterranean. Their fate is 
        still unclear.
      </p>

      <p>
        As investigation documents from the Italian authorities will show later on,
        the security forces in the port will place a bug on the bridge of the 
        "Iuventa" on this occasion. In the coming months, you will hear all the
        conversations in the ship's control room. They also monitor the phones of 
        Italian crew members and supporters. With a large-scale surveillance operation, 
        Italian investigators are now focusing on the people who are saving lives in 
        the Mediterranean.

        19 May 2017 – Dodgy orders from Italy
      </h2>

      <p>
        The MRCC's unusual orders will increase in the coming weeks. On 19 May, the 
        "Iuventa" is to leave the area of operation at the will of the MRCC to bring 
        26 refugees to Lampedusa. Although the refugees could be handed over to a large
        ship of the Italian coast guard, they are to be handed over by the "Iuventa" 
        directly in Lampedusa. The crew explains to the MRCC that the passage by small 
        boat is unsafe. Even the Italian coastguard cannot understand the MRCC's behaviour. 
        However, the coordinating centre will continue to give instructions without giving 
        any reasons.

        The MRCC's action will be repeated on 12 June. Once again, the "Iuventa" 
        is ordered to Lampedusa with 28 refugees on board, although other ships 
        could accommodate the people. On 19 May and 12 June, the "Iuventa" will 
        be received by the police and the coast guard at the port of Lampedusa 
        and the crews will be interrogated again. Again, the "Iuventa" cannot answer 
        emergency calls from the sea rescue area at this time.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="content-container">
      <p>
        Obviously, the policemen's interrogation is also about alleged contact with 
        a ship called "Shada", a ghost ship allegedly involved in arms smuggling. 
        As it will become clear later on, the authorities accuse "Jugend Rettet" 
        of having exchanged views with the crew of the "Shada". They're not presenting 
        evidence of that. They can only show that the ships were close to each other 
        on one day. However, the investigators' own records also show that completely 
        different actors were present at the time in question: The Italian police ship 
        Sirio409p inspected the "Shada".
      </p>

      <p>
        The incident shows: The authorities are apparently working on collecting material 
        that they can use against "Jugend Rettet".

        June 18, 2017 – Sea Rescue at Breaking Point
      </h2>

      <p>
        The 18th of June 2017 begins with an emergency call before sunrise. 
        The MRCC instructs the "Iuventa" to rescue a wooden boat that is still in 
        Libyan waters at 4:40 in the morning. When the ship arrives at 6:20 a. m. 
        at the sea border between Libya and international territory, it meets three 
        wooden boats and a rubber boat with refugees from Libya. On the instructions 
        of the MRCC,"Jugend Rettet" starts evacuating the boats together with another 
        NGO, which was also sent to the rescue centre.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the course of the rescue, another rubber boat from Libya will be added. 
        An additional NGO also reaches the base and helps to rescue refugees from 
        the boats. The "Iuventa" takes a total of 97 refugees on board, other refugees 
        arrive on other ships. Both rubber boats are still being destroyed in the water.
      </p>

      {{image name="iuventa" language="de" type="content"}}

      <p>
        In the confusing scenery, so-called Engine Fisher from the Libyan coast are added.
        This is not uncommon in the zone off Libya. They unscrew the engines from the other
        boats, take the three wooden boats in tow and drive back to Libya.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Italians will later accuse "Jugend Rettet" of having worked with the Libyans.
        They don't have proof of that. The photographs presented by the Italian investigators
        are misleadingly titled.
      </p>

      <p>
        The MRCC does not want to stand up for "Jugend Rettet" in this context. The 
        authorities themselves had ordered the organisation to the place of deployment 
        and coordinated the emergency rescue, as the deployment protocols show. In the 
        following weeks the MRCC's behaviour will become even more questionable.

        August 2, 2017 – Politically Motivated Prosecution
      </h2>

      <p>
        At the end of July, the EU is forced to take action in the light of media 
        reports of dying in the Mediterranean. It does not focus on human rights 
        violations in Libya, however, but targets rescue workers: while the military 
        is awarded medals for rescue operations, the German Interior Minister 
        Thomas de Maiziére accuses civilian organisations of committing crimes in the
        Mediterranean Sea. The EU wants the Sailors to sign a <a href="{{assetpath type="content"}}/documents/code_of_conduct.pdf">Code 
        of Conduct</a>. Among other things, it stipulates that Italian police officers 
        should be allowed to board civilian ships and that small ships such as the "Iuventa"
        should no longer be allowed to hand over refugees to larger ships, where they 
        could be better served. It quickly becomes apparent that most organisations, 
        including "Jugend Rettet", will not sign the text. A report by the scientific
        service in the Bundestag describes parts of the document as contrary to 
        international law. Nevertheless, the Italian Minister of the Interior, to whom 
        the MRCC is also subordinate, threatens to deny organisations access to Italian
        ports.
      </p>

      <aside class="aside aside--portrait">
        {{image name="rescue" language="de" type="aside"}}
      </aside>

      <p>
        On 1 August, one day after the deadline for signature of the Code of Conduct 
        expires,"Iuventa" receives an emergency call from the MRCC. At 5:32 a. m., the 
        ship is unusually instructed to sail in the central Mediterranean Sea in an area 
        with a width of 700 nautical miles and a search grid at a distance of three nautical
        miles. Normally, such a search operation is assigned a case number by the control center.
        However, this is not the case. It would take 40 hours to complete the grid. The MRCC is
        therefore proposing that the civil search aircraft "Moonbird" should also be sent out to
        the MRCC. The pilots could leave the search area within a few hours. However, the MRCC 
        rejects: The center would send its own helicopter, so there is a risk of collision. Even 
        after eight hours the helicopter is not visible above the search area. The ship of another
        rescue mission may not participate in the search and the dinghy of the "Iuventa" may not be
        let into the water. Instead, the MRCC cancels the search in the early evening - with no 
        result.
      </p>

      <p>
        Immediately afterwards, the MRCC instructs the "Iuventa" to approach the port of 
        Lampedusa with two refugees on board. When the ship arrives there the following 
        night at 2 a. m., not only the usual police officers and the coast guard are waiting
        for the ship, but also journalists. In the morning, articles appear in all Italian 
        media that accuse "Iuventa" of crimes, illustrated with photos from Italian secret 
        service archives.
      </p>

      <p>
        The crew will be interrogated and the ship confiscated during the day. The order 
        for this was signed on August 1, as the investigation documents show - while the 
        "Iuventa" had to drive a search pattern in the Mediterranean Sea by order of the MRCC.

          Epilogue: The EU Looks Away
      </h2>

      <p>
        On 2 August, the "Iuventa" is set on Lampedusa and brought to Sicily by the 
        Italian authorities. The Italian coastguard begins a mission within Libyan 
        territorial waters to "stop migration flows", as Italy says. On 7 August, the 
        EU-funded Libyan coastguard in international waters threatens the rescue ship of 
        the Spanish organisation "Open Arms" and shoots at the crew. Like other civilian 
        rescuers, they continue to drive missions, but at a much higher risk. On August 10, 
        the Libyan military declares its own "search and rescue zone" within 70 miles of 
        Libya and prohibits NGOs from driving in it, even though this is contrary to 
        international law. Militias supported by the EU prevent refugees from leaving 
        Libya. The Mediterranean route is closed. The MRCC coordinates considerably 
        fewer sea rescue operations. In Italy, the campaign for the parliamentary 
        elections begins.
      </p>

      <p>
        The "Iuventa" remains confiscated even after a trial, a complaint so far 
        unsuccessful. Further missions of civilian rescue ships must be broken off
        in the face of threats from Libyans. Public awareness of the deaths in the
        Mediterranean Sea is falling sharply in the face of the forced withdrawal 
        of organisations.
      </p>

      <p>
        The EU continues to cooperate with Libya, despite the desolate conditions 
        in the camps there and the criminal behaviour of the so-called Libyan 
        coastguard.
